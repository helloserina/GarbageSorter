# GarbageSorter

This is an application creating during SDHacks 2019 Hackathon.

As students, we don't have time to think about where to throw away certain waste products. The waste containers are labelled vaguely and students often throw away their garbage in the wrong places. To educate these students, provide a regulated system and promote a more sustainable environment, we thought of the idea of an application that would easily direct students to throw away their trash in the correct bins. In addition, certain locations on campus would have bins specially made to collect certain recyclable and reusable items that students can drop their recyclables at and redeem points. This incentive would attract users and motivate them to be mindful of the environment.

Garbage Sorter is an application that tells users where their trash should be disposed. Broken down into various categories (Waste, Compost, Recycling, Hazardous Waste), users can find information on which categories their trash belongs in. In addition, Garbage Sorter was intended to include a database containing descriptions and images of the items as well as the locations of the bins on campus that collect each particular item.
